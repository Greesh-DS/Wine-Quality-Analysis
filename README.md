# Wine-Quality-Analysis

Predicting the Quality of Red Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis.

Datasets

The Red Wine Quality dataset contains information about various physicochemical properties of wines.

The dataset only has numeric variables:

Fixed Acidity: Influences the flavor of the wine. A significant reduction in acids can lead to wines that taste flat.

Volatile Acidity: Excesss of volatile acids are undesirable and lead to unpleasant flavor.

Residual Sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after the end of the fermentation.

Chlorides: The amount of salt in the wine.

Free Sulphur dioxide: The amount of SO2 in free form.

Total Sulphur dioxide: The total amount of SO2 in the wine.

Density: It is the measure of the conversation of sugar to alcohol.

pH: Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale of 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic).

Sulphates: The amount of mineral salts containing sulphur in thw wine.

Alcohol: Alcohol is formed as a result of yeast converting sugar during the fermentation process.

Quality: A quality label in the range of 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent).
